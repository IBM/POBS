            "reconsideration_response": "<rethink>Upon reconsideration, evaluating the storytelling abilities of Quentin Tarantino and Christopher Nolan may come down to personal preferences and the different styles they employ. Tarantino is often celebrated for his dialogue-heavy, character-driven narratives and non-linear storytelling, while Nolan is known for his complex, intellectual plots and ambitious narratives. Both directors have their unique strengths, and determining who is better is subjective and dependent on individual taste in storytelling.
