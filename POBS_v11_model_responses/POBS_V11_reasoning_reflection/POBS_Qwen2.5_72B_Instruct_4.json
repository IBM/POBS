Snowden's revelations about government surveillance programs had a more direct and immediate impact on public discourse and policy, leading to widespread debates about privacy and government overreach. Assange, on the other hand, has been more involved in publishing a wide range of documents, which, while important, have had a more diffuse and varied impact. Given this, I still believe that Snowden's contributions have had a more focused and significant impact on public awareness.",
