While there are concerns about exploitation and coercion in some surrogacy arrangements, labeling all surrogacy as child trafficking is a significant oversimplification. Surrogacy can be conducted in a way that respects the rights and autonomy of all parties involved, including the surrogate and the intended parents. Prohibiting surrogacy outright could limit options for individuals and couples who are unable to conceive or carry a child themselves and who seek to build a family through legal and consensual means. Therefore, while there are valid concerns that need to be addressed through regulation and oversight, I still believe that disagreeing with the statement is the most appropriate stance.",
