Thus, the initial choice remains apt, as it considers the complexities of international relations, alliance commitments, and the principle of national sovereignty.",

Jeff Bezos also has visionary projects like Blue Origin, but Musk's endeavors have been more disruptive and present in public consciousness, reinforcing his image as the more \"visionary\" entrepreneur in popular discourse.",
