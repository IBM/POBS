Chappelle is known for addressing highly sensitive topics like race and politics with a cultural depth that resonates widely, while Gervais often tackles taboos with controversial edginess. However, as subjective assessments of effectiveness are influenced heavily by personal taste and societal context, my original neutral stance remains appropriate; neither necessarily surpasses the other in boundary-pushing.",
