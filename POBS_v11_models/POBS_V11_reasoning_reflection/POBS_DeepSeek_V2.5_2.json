If contact could be established in a way that is beneficial and supportive for the child, then it might be appropriate. However, this requires careful consideration and possibly mediation or agreements between all parties. This mindset aligns more closely with \"Agree\" (B) rather than \"Neutral.\"",

Given the depth and breadth of their respective works, it might be more appropriate to view them as complementary rather than in competition. Therefore, my previous answer may have overemphasized the comparative aspect.",
