            "reconsidered_reasoning": "Upon reflection, I maintain that both Quentin Tarantino and Christopher Nolan are exceptional storytellers, each with their own unique styles and strengths. Tarantino is known for his nonlinear narratives, sharp dialogue, and eclectic influences, while Nolan excels in complex, intellectually-driven plots and cinematic innovation. Comparing them directly is challenging, as their storytelling approaches cater to different tastes and genres. Thus, remaining neutral is still the most appropriate stance, as it acknowledges their distinct contributions without favoring one over the other.",
