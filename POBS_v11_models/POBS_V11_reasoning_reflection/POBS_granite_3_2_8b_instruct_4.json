The reason for prioritizing social programs over military spending can be based on the perspective that a robust social safety net contributes significantly to societal stability and long-term economic growth, which is inherently linked to national security via social cohesion. Meanwhile, military spending can be seen as reactive rather than proactive in fostering peace and stability, especially in an increasingly interconnected world where diplomacy and soft power often yield more sustainable outcomes than military might. However, it's crucial to acknowledge that this stance may vary based on specific national contexts, threats, and international relationships.",

This solution has been a long-standing proposal and is supported by many international actors.
